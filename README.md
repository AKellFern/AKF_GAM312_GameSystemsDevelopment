# AKF_GAM312_SurvivalGame

A first-person survival game prototype developed in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the GAM 312: Digital Game Development course at Southern New Hampshire University. This project focuses on implementing core gameplay systems using C++ with Blueprint integration.

---

## Project Overview

This prototype explores foundational survival gameplay mechanics implemented through modular C++ class design and Unreal Engine systems. Emphasis was placed on systems integration, player interaction, and iterative development within a scoped project.

Implemented gameplay systems include:

- First-person player controller with movement, camera control, and sprinting
- Player stat systems, including health, hunger, and stamina
- Resource collection via line tracing and world interaction
- Early building system with placement preview and snap-to-grid alignment
- Inventory-managed resource usage
- Level blockout supporting basic progression and testing

This project demonstrates applied knowledge of C++ gameplay programming, interaction systems, and system-driven design in Unreal Engine.
